# Clock Description
This is a nice clock with big segments and you can set color and intesity of each segment. There are three buttons, buzzer, light sensor and RTC with battery backup. The clock is powered through USB C and has features such current time, timer and stopwatch. Feel free to add your own features!

Why I designed this clock?
- it's a very simple project, so it was fun
- I often need a clock with big display and the right color and intensity when checking time in the middle of the night without my glasses on
- I often need a simple timer or stopwatch for example when cooking
