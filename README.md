# About this Clock Project
I created this clock for everyone who is interested in electronics. Even if you have never designed any electronics before, by following this step-by-step youtube tutorial you will design and manufacture this clock.

Watch and follow the tutorial here: *Coming soon*

# Clock Description
This is a nice clock with big segments and you can set color and intesity of each segment. There are three buttons, buzzer, light sensor and RTC with battery backup. The clock is powered through USB C and has also features like timer and stopwatch. Feel free to add your own features!

Why I designed this clock?
- it's very simple project, so it was fun
- I often need a clock with big display and the right color and intensity when checking time in the middle of the night without my glasses on
- I often need a simple timer or stopwatch for example when cooking
